# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) are also included in this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn server`

Runs a local JSON server. To provide the server with data, add JSON to `db.json`

See https://github.com/typicode/json-server for more information.
